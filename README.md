## Pokemon API


### Version 1: show one

Create a React app that:

- gets the information for a pokemon character from https://pokeapi.co/
- displays the deatils for the character in a Component

### Version 2: show a list

Call the API's `/pokemon` route to get an array of characters: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=100&limit=100`

- create a component that shows each character's name as an `<li>`

### Version 3: show the details from the list

Make each character's name in the list clickable.
When you click the character's name, it should show that character's details in a Component (the one you built in Version 1)
